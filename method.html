    <h2><u>Generating Gender Roles in Kathak: How Female Kathak Dancers See and Experience Gender</u></h2>
    <body>
        <h3><u>Method and Design</u></h3>
      
      <h4>Sources of Evidence</h4>
       <p>This research will be qualitative in nature, with data collected using textual and non-textual methods, in addition to face-to-face questionnaires. The evidence will be drawn from the following sources:
         <ol>
           <li>Interviews with female Kathak dancers</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Location - India, United States, United Kingdom</li>
              <li>Age Range - 20-40</li>
              <li>Language - English, Hindi, Marathi</li>
              <li>All Socioeconomic Backgrounds</li>
            </ul>
           <li>Photographs and Artwork of <i>Prominent Kathak</i> Performers/Performance</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Location - India</li>
              <li>Time Range - 1950-2020 (Photographs/Videos), No Parameters (Artwork)</li>
             </ul>
        </ol>
      </p>
    
    <h4>Reasoning and Analysis</h4>
      <p>The research question necessitates the variety of data sources due to the vast historical and cultural background of Kathak. The samples will contain 75-100 photographs and pieces of visual artwork, and 20-25 video performances. Of these, the majority will feature prominent performers because these individuals are most widely known in the field and have therefore shaped the dance form more profoundly given their presence in the media. Furthermore, 25 interview participants will be selected in order to collect elaborate evidence; surveys would not suffice here because they would not adequately explain the participants’ mindsets. All interviews will follow the same question content and order. There will be a short stimulus of visual imagery, shown from the photographic and other visual data, which each participant will remark upon after being given the prompt word “gender.”</p> 
      <p>Following data collection, textual and non-textual thematic analysis will be performed on the data; the interviews will also be coded for descriptive themes and a general understanding of these themes. While there are no formal qualifications needed to carry out this research, it would prove useful to consult Kathak Visharad (BA) and Kathak Alankaar (MA) holders for their invaluable expertise on dance theory and practicum. The ethical implications for this research include the potential “creation” of physical dissonance and poor body image in the participating interviewees because of the questions posed. In this research, the examination of the visual media may need to be more prominent than the interviews during analysis.</p>
      <p>Results which suggest a strong correlation between taught and observed “gender” in Kathak would confirm the hypothesis that Kathak theory and pedagogy leaves a discernible mark on female Kathak dancers’ ideas of gender creation and gender roles.</p>
